# SICP-Learning
**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**<br>

To touch magic in the real world, SICP gives good reference!<br>
Just kidding... Though the abstraction really give great aesthetic pleasure<br>
<br>

### **environment**<br>
sicp takes Mit-Scheme in practice, a good choice, but old.<br>
PLT-Scheme(Racket) gives DrRacket, a good choice.<br>
chezscheme is very fast, also a good choice!<br> 
In this repo, I use racket to run my scheme code.<br>
